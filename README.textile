h1. JRuby IRC Bot

IRC bot for #jruby on irc.freenode.net.

h2. Description

Using the "Cinch Ruby IRC plugin framework":https://github.com/injekt/cinch, an IRC bot for the #jruby channel on the Freenode network was created.

It is used to respond to:

* Jira ticket information requests.
* Notify the channel about newly created Jira tickets.

h2. INSTALL

To get the bot up and running, ensure you are running on at least Ruby 1.9.2 and 'bundle install' to get the gems installed and run:

* ruby bot.rb

All the cronlike things are handled by the bots internal timers.

*NOTE:* Currently the bot is not run as a daemon nor does it do any file logging so it is best to run the bot in a screen session.
